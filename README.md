HoloBlade: An Open-Hardware Spatial Light Modulator Driver Platform<br/>
###################################################################<br/>

Overview:<br/>
Spatial light modulators (SLMs) are an important tool for applied optics research across a range of diverse fields such as holographic  displays, telecommunications, astronomy, microscopy and optical computing. However, contemporary SLMs are very much a high-end scientific tool and are not very accessible to the wider research community. HoloBlade is an attempt to democratise access to SLMs.<br/>

The primary application for HoloBlade is holographic display applications, but it is also applicable to adjacent research fields utilising SLMs. By providing an open-source SLM driver-stack, it is hoped to makes SLMs lower-cost, more accessbile and to use HoloBlade as a foundation platform to catalyse the development of Holographic Display Systems.

Directory Structure:
- fpga_firmware<br/>
  - verilog:   Main executable code for the FPGA is in here. Several components are generated from myHDL and have to be copied into here.<br/>
  - myHDL:     Most of the individual compoennts are designed, tested and simulated using myHDL and then sythesised to verilog. The myHDL components are in this directory along with scripts for generating them.<br/>
- electronics: Contains the HoloBlade bespoke electronics design files<br/>
- pc_software: Contains the GUI and driver calls to drive the HoloBlade driver-stack. Currently just supports .NET on Windows.<br/>
- mechanical:  STL files for the optomechanical mount for the main electornics board and SLM<br/>
- docs:        Any key supporting documentation (eg: datasheet)<br/>

HoloBlade is released under the CERN Open Hardware Licenceâ€™s permissive variant, CERN-OHL-P v2, see https://cern.ch/cern-ohl.
